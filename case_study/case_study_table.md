# PoincaréRAG Response Case Study (Legal Dataset)

This table illustrates how PoincaréRAG handles different types of queries using real data from the Legal dataset (Credit Agreements, Amendments, etc.).

| Scenario Type | Query & Response | Geometric Logic & Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scenario I: Single-hop Retrieval**<br>*(Leaf Node Precision)* | **QUERY:** "What is the maturity date of the credit agreement?"<br><br>**POINCARÉRAG ANSWER:** The Maturity Date is explicitly defined as **April 30, 2021**. This specific date applies to the 364-Day Credit Agreement among Cummins Inc. and the Lenders.<br><br>**EVIDENCE:** Section 1.01 (Definitions): "“Maturity Date” means April 30, 2021" `[Doc 2, 364-Day Credit Agreement]` | **Geometric Logic:** Leaf-node precision task.<br>`zq = Embed("Maturity Date") → nearest leaf node in the Definitions subtree`<br><br>**Process Analysis:** Standard RAG might retrieve generic "Term" or "Termination" clauses. PoincaréRAG maps the specific legal term "Maturity Date" to its exact definition leaf node in the hyperbolic space, minimizing distance to the precise date `April 30, 2021`. |
| **Scenario II: Multi-hop Reasoning**<br>*(Entailment & Traversal)* | **QUERY:** "What are the consequences if a person executing the Second Amendment is not fully authorized to do so?"<br><br>**POINCARÉRAG ANSWER:** The validity of the amendment relies on the representation that the executor is **fully authorized**. If unauthorized, the amendment may be voidable or unenforceable, as the signatory explicitly warrants their authority to bind the entity.<br><br>**EVIDENCE:** Second Amendment to Golf Course Use Agreement: "...represents and warrants that such person is fully authorized to execute this Second [Amendment]..." `[Doc 1, Second Amendment]` | **Geometric Logic:** Multi-hop traversal task via a shared ancestor.<br>`Path = Geodesic(Execution → Authorization → Validity)`<br><br>**Process Analysis:** The answer connects the act of "Execution" with the condition of "Authorization". PoincaréRAG models these concepts as structurally connected nodes. The retrieval traverses the path from the signature block requirements back to the warranty clauses to establish the consequence of unauthorized execution. |
| **Scenario III: Global Aggregation**<br>*(Summarization)* | **QUERY:** "What are the negative covenants imposed on the Company and its Subsidiaries?"<br><br>**POINCARÉRAG ANSWER:** The Company is subject to a structured set of negative covenants that restrict its financial and operational flexibility. Key restrictions include **Negative Pledges** (Sec 6.01), limitations on **Mergers, Consolidations, and Sales of Assets** (Sec 6.02), and constraints on incurring **Priority Indebtedness** (Sec 6.03).<br><br>**EVIDENCE:** Article 6 (Negative Covenants): "Section 6.01. Negative Pledge... Section 6.02. Mergers... Section 6.03. Priority Indebtedness" `[Doc 2, Article 6]` | **Geometric Logic:** Global aggregation task.<br>`Search region = hyperbolic barycenter (Fréchet mean) of the "Negative Covenants" subtree`<br><br>**Process Analysis:** Instead of retrieving a single random covenant, PoincaréRAG identifies the "Negative Covenants" parent node and retrieves the cluster of children nodes (Sections 6.01, 6.02, 6.03). This allows for a comprehensive summary of the *entire* set of constraints rather than a fragmented partial answer. |
